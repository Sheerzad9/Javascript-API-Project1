# Javascript-API-Project1
I found this API (Rest countries) in githubs "Public apis" section, link: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis 
So in this app I use https://restcountries.com/ API. Using Rest countries API I am able to get up to date data from different countries which user searches for. 
When data has been fetched the searched country will be visible under "Home country" section with country flag, current population, region etc... fun facts.
Same things will be shown of it's all neighbouring countries aswell.
